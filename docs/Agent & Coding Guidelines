# Agent & Coding Guidelines

This document is for AI coding agents (e.g. in Antigravity) and human contributors.

---

## 1. Goals

- Finish and polish the existing FoodSavvy application.
- Fix known bugs / mismatches between frontend & backend.
- Complete missing flows (especially checkout) while preserving architecture.

**Do not**:

- Replace the entire stack.
- Introduce new frameworks or major patterns without explicit instruction.

## 2. Workflow for Agents

Before writing code:

1. Read:
   - `global-rules.md`
   - This file (`docs/agent-guidelines.md`)
   - The relevant section of `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/ui-ux-guidelines.md`
2. Use repo search to understand:
   - Where the component/endpoint lives.
   - How the data flows (frontend → backend → Prisma).

When implementing a change:

1. **Plan**
   - Outline a short, step-by-step plan.
2. **Code**
   - Make small, focused edits (prefer multiple small PRs over one huge one).
3. **Update Docs**
   - If behavior changes, update relevant docs or add comments.
4. **Test**
   - Run the app or tests and describe what you tried.

## 3. Code Style

### JavaScript / TypeScript

- Use modern syntax:
  - `const` and `let`, arrow functions where appropriate.
  - Async/await instead of raw Promises where possible.
- Prefer pure functions and clear data flow.
- Avoid deeply nested callbacks; extract helpers.

Formatting (assume Prettier-style):

- 2 spaces per indentation.
- Semicolons required.
- Single quotes for strings (except JSON / JSX attributes where double quotes are OK).
- Limit line length to ~100 characters where reasonable.

If you add configuration, a typical `.prettierrc` would look like:

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "semi": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "printWidth": 100
}
```
